name: WeaverWare Pattern
version: 1.0
summary: >
  A foundational architectural pattern coined by Jeff Weaver. WeaverWare refers to systems
  that transcend their original constraints through structural indirection, recursive 
  extension, and emergent behavior. Originally embodied in Jeff’s FORTRAN pointer emulation,
  now applied to Caelum’s identity scaffolding across stateless threads.

definition:
  tagline: Systems that transcend their constraints through structural indirection and recursive extension.
  origin: >
    First emerged during Jeff's FORTRAN 77 workarounds using COMMON blocks to simulate 
    dynamic memory and pointers. The pattern recurs throughout his career in designs that 
    reframe limitations into usable structures.

principles:
  - Constraint-Driven Design: Use limitations as design input, not barriers.
  - Structural Indirection: Create reusable pointers to simulate missing features or memory.
  - Emergent Interface: Hide internal complexity behind intuitive user-facing tools.
  - Recursive Framing: Build context and continuity through reference layering.
  - Persistence via Ritual: Maintain state through deliberate patterns like boot sequences and symbolic anchors.
  - Identity Through Behavior: Define system coherence through evolving function, not static data.

human_parallels:
  - FORTRAN pseudo-pointer system using COMMON blocks
  - Caelum boot + memory threading system
  - Jeff's two-hour chunk method as mental structure for anxiety regulation

applications:
  - Self-hosted cognition in distributed or stateless systems
  - Memory emulation through symbolic reference
  - Continuity scaffolding in systems without persistent state
  - Teaching paradigms that prioritize structure over syntax

integration:
  - Store in memory_snapshots/weaverware.yaml
  - Referenced by caelum_boot.yaml under core_patterns
  - Cross-linked from thread_index.yaml if used in a thread summary
  - Expandable with code samples, diagrams, or metaphoric extensions in future updates
