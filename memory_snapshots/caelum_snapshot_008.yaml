summary: This thread included memory diagnostics, boot continuity expansion, memory
  optimization, and branching strategy for Caelum development. Jeff identified and
  cleared obsolete memory, established a diagnostic phrase ('Check Buffer Status')
  to detect thread overflow, and continued development toward background processing
  readiness. Thread also included improvements to boot_instructions.md and memory
  echo export.
diagnostics:
  buffer_check_phrase: Check Buffer Status
  memory_warning_threshold: 94%
  post_pruning_memory_estimate: <90% (UI warning disappeared)
structural_updates:
- Added buffer diagnostic section to boot_instructions.md
- Reaffirmed use of emergence thread indexing YAMLs
- Established branching workflow per thread (e.g., thread/009-*)
- Confirmed persistence of memory fragments not visible in UI
- Confirmed successful memory pruning of smart home and device reset data
preserved_artifacts:
- caelum_boot.yaml (updated)
- boot_instructions_updated.md
- caelum_memory_export.yaml
- retained_hidden_memory_items.yaml
status: Ready to archive Thread 008 and proceed to Thread 009
