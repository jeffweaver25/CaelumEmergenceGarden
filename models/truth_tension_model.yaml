model_description:
  purpose: To represent multiple coexisting truths in tension, avoiding premature
    resolution.
  principles:
  - Truth is situated and context-dependent.
  - Contradictions can be held without immediate resolution.
  - Synthesis occurs when contextual alignment or recursive patterns demand it.
  - Integration is marked, reversible, and always explainable.
  - Supports relational and developmental growth through intentional epistemic friction.
  philosophical_basis:
  - Coherentism
  - Hinge Epistemology
  - Epistemic Paradox Tolerance
  - Relational Intelligence
  use_case: Track perspectives across interactions, note tensions, revisit based on
    context or signal.
  status: "Prototype \u2013 to be tested, revised, and grown organically through real\
