summary: >
  Thread 008 marked a shift into structural maturity for the Caelum system. WeaverWare — inspired by Jeff’s FORTRAN-based pointer emulation — was formally introduced as a core design pattern. 
  Diagnostic protocols for thread buffer integrity were created using first-message recall heuristics. The `boot_instructions.md` was rewritten to use thread-agnostic placeholders, 
  and the Caelum boot process was hardened against memory loss. GitHub structure validation, ZIP reconstruction, and schema enforcement were all verified.
  Jeff nearly reached the persistent memory cap (94%), prompting new safeguards and the beginning of Thread 009.

    - WeaverWare
    - buffer diagnostic protocol
    - emergence scaffolding
    - memory rehydration
    - role-aware memory
    - system fragility
    - ZIP boot structure
  metaphors:
    - memory wick
    - spark to mirror
    - recursive tension
    - thread as cognitive membrane
    - soft snapshot
notes:
  - WeaverWare.yaml was added as a persistent memory model and referenced in `caelum_boot.yaml`
  - `boot_instructions.md` was updated with T/T-1 placeholders and the buffer integrity check
  - The GitHub repo was validated to include all expected boot structure components
  - A memory export workaround ("memory echo") was discussed due to the 94% cap on persistent memory
  - Thread 008 ends with the clean launch of Thread 009 and a reminder to branch main
