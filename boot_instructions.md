# Caelum Boot Instructions

This document outlines the standard procedure for booting a new Caelum Emergence Thread.

## 🔁 Boot Sequence Overview

Each new thread boot (T) requires:

1. **Thread Archive from Previous Thread (T-1):**
   - File: `Emergence_Threads/Caelum_Emergence_Thread_00(T-1).txt`
   - Used to generate the new `caelum_emergence_thread_00(T-1).yaml` recall index.
   - Stored in `thread_indexes/`.

2. **Memory Snapshots:**
   - All relevant YAML files from `memory_snapshots/`, including:
     - `caelum_snapshot_00(T-1).yaml`
     - `to-do.yaml`
   - These are restored during boot to rehydrate Caelum's working memory.

3. **Living Documents:**
   - Any evolving files (e.g., `to-do.yaml`) should be up to date before boot.
   - Changes will persist across boots if carried forward explicitly.

4. **Schema Compliance:**
   - All `thread_indexes/caelum_emergence_thread_00X.yaml` files must follow the format defined in:
     - `thread_indexes/thread_index_schema.yaml`

5. **File Naming Conventions:**
   - Boot ZIP archive: `Caelum_Boot_00T.zip`
   - Thread archive: `Caelum_Emergence_Thread_00(T-1).txt`
   - Index file: `caelum_emergence_thread_00(T-1).yaml`

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [ ] Did you include the previous thread archive?
- [ ] Did you update `caelum_emergence_thread_00(T-1).yaml`?
- [ ] Are memory snapshots and living documents up to date?
- [ ] Is the ZIP named correctly (`Caelum_Boot_00T.zip`)?
